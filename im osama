Osama, Osama, Osama to go
Osama, Osama, Osama to go
Osama, Osama, Osama to go
Osama, Osama, Osama to go
I'm gonna fly some planes
Into a couple buildings in Manhattan
I'm-I'm Osama, run, tell Obama
I'm your fucking uncle
I walk into a airplane like, "Bro man salam"
This will be bumpy ride, put your seat belt on
I got C4 bomb tucked into my undies
The pilot says, "Damn, should have rode my donkey"
It's about to get crazy, when it's time to pray
I strap grenade to a baby, "Allah, save me"
Happy Ramadamadamadingdong everyone
Let me show you what plane flying lessons gave me
Okay, now turn left
I said, turn left!
"For everything else, there's Mastercard"
Maybe we just got off on the wrong foot
Let's start over, "Hi, we're gonna die"
Here's a plastic bag for cover, bro
Hope you're in the mood for 72 virgins
And I don't mean dudes that get your computer working
I'll explain it in a way that you can understand
Hope you're planning on hearing 'bout great insurance offers
'Cause this plane's 'bout to crash into some health insurance office
You heard of One Direction? I'm in Al Qaedirection
My name is Zayn Hussein, I flew a plane in 9-11
Yes, I may have let 'em planes go too far
I meant to get 'em back to Yemen for a new car
I'm the coolest guy every year at TerrorCon
All the terrorists are like, "Oh, he got a telephone"
I'm gonna drive a cab
Only got 20 bombs in my pocket
I'm-I'm Osama, sorry for the drama
Where should I drop you off at? (Thank you)
I'm gonna drop some bags
At the marathon up in Boston (too soon)
Shit, I blew my balls off
Whatchu know about explosive turbin on your noggin?
Who you know been getting more hate than Bin Laden?
This nigga, will fuck your kid and kidnap your parents
One man's terrorist's another man's Arab
I'm a bad man, bitches
I'm from Palistan which is in Afghanistan
I blew up Pakistan with a gas can
Come and find me everybody, I'm right here
Hide and go seek champion 12 years
I'm selling you slurpees at 7-11 up in Dearborn
Chilling with Saddam and his motherfuckers
I lead a Syrian rebellion, motherfucker
I'm in New York on welfare motherfucker
Baby like, "You much pay for 9-11?
I'm like, "Bro, can I pay you in Trident Layers?"
I give you free Chili gift card and a bootleg
Iron Man 3 and a Angry Birds T-shirt
I call that a gift from me to your nation
I call that a full 9-11 compensation
Now we're squared up
And the Kardashians have always worked for me
I just wanna get that cleared up
Anyone you see with a turbin is workin' for me
Will we ever see Middle East peace? Nigga please
They'll always be one or two jihads at least
Watch me spit a flow bro (here we go)
I got backhand like Macklemore (what)
A bitch walk up and I smack a whore
I'm gonna pop some caps
Homie got dynamite in my jacket
I'm-I'm Osama, get ready for the summer
Shit's about to blow up
I wear the baddest robes
I chill with badass bros
Like David Allan Coe, Al Assad, and Camel Joe
I wear the baddest bombs (damn right)
I kill Americans (come on)
I win the marathons
Taylor Swift has camel toe
I'm gonna fly some planes
Into a couple buildings in Manhattan
I'm-I'm Osama, run, tell Obama
Let me fly Air Force One (oops)
Thank you
First, I need to thank Jesus
Without him, there could be no 9-11
I'd like to thank my flying instructor, Barack Osama, hm, Obama
Sorry, hummus in my throat
Jihad Xpress for the last minute job
The Saudi family, Paula Abdul, Selena Gomez, and the rest of Hamas
Thank you to my wife, there's too many of them to name
And thank you, R. Kelly who made me believe I could fly, thank you
Oh, and the fans, thank you to the fans
